Ask the user to enter Number1
Ask the user to enter Number2
Ask the user to enter the variables "+,-,*,%,/"
If the operator is "+" 
then compute results "number1 + number2"
If the operators if -
then compute results "number1 - number2"
If the operator is *
then compute results "number1 * number2"
If the operator is /
then compute results "number1 / number2"
If the operator is %
then compute results "number1 % number2"
Print the results to the user
